# Mexico Crime Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive crime analysis dashboard focused on crime patterns in Mexico from 2015 to 2023. The purpose is to help law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and stakeholders understand crime dynamics, identify hotspots, and make informed decisions for resource allocation and crime prevention.

## Objectives

- Analyze trends and distribution of crime over time.
- Identify the most common crime types in the country.
- Pinpoint states with the highest and lowest crime rates.
- Support data-driven decision-making for crime prevention.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric                  | Value    |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Total Reported Crimes   | 332,416K |
| Number of Crime Types   | 39       |
| Years Covered           | 2015-2023|

## Tools and Technologies

- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard development.
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.
- Excel for initial data handling (if applicable).

## Dashboard Features

- **Crime Trends by Year and Type:** Line charts showing crime type evolution year over year.
- **Monthly Crime Patterns:** Identifies seasonal spikes and patterns in crimes.
- **Crime Distribution by Type:** Donut charts displaying the proportion of each crime type.
- **Crime Distribution by State:** Geographical heatmaps highlighting states with higher crime rates.
- **Top States by Crime Category:** Bar charts showing states with the highest instances of specific crime types.
- **Dynamic Filters:** Ability to filter data by year and crime type for deeper analysis.

## Key Insights

- Robbery is the most frequently reported crime, making up approximately 35% of total reported crimes.
- Domestic violence, fraud, and drug trafficking have shown increasing trends over recent years.
- Crime rates generally rose until 2019, after which some categories stabilized or declined.
- Specific states consistently report higher crime rates, indicating the need for targeted interventions.

## Business Recommendations

1. **Resource Allocation:** Prioritize deployment of police and security resources to high-crime states, especially for robbery and domestic violence.
2. **Policy Development:** Introduce focused programs to address the increase in domestic violence and fraud.
3. **Seasonal Policing Strategies:** Deploy more law enforcement resources during peak crime months identified in the dashboard.
4. **Community Engagement:** Launch community-based crime prevention initiatives in regions with escalating crime.
